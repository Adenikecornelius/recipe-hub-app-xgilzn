Here's the plan:\n\n**1. Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Browse Recipes:** A home screen displaying a list of available recipes with images, titles, and brief descriptions.\n-   **Recipe Details:** A detailed view for each recipe, including the full ingredient list, step-by-step cooking instructions, preparation time, and serving size.\n-   **Save Recipes:** Functionality for users to save their favorite recipes to a personal collection.\n\n**2. Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Beige)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#777777` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#A0522D` (Sienna)\n    *   Secondary: `#D2691E` (Chocolate)\n    *   Accent: `#BC8F8F` (Rosy Brown)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#E9967A` (Dark Salmon)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**3. Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Update the home screen to display a list of recipes. Each recipe item should include an image, title, and a brief description. This could involve fetching recipe data from a local array or, ideally, a Supabase database (if the user enables it).\n    *   Implement navigation to a detailed recipe view when a recipe item is pressed.\n    *   Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\n2.  **Create a new file `app/recipe/[id].tsx`:**\n    *   This file will contain the detailed recipe view.\n    *   It should display the recipe's image, title, ingredient list, cooking instructions, preparation time, and serving size.\n    *   Implement a \"Save\" button that allows users to save the recipe.\n\n3.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`:**\n    *   Ensure the tab bar is visible and functional.\n\n4.  **Create a new file `app/(tabs)/saved.tsx`:**\n    *   This file will display the list of saved recipes.\n\n**4. Instructions for the coding agent:**\n\n1.  Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to display a list of recipes with images, titles, and brief descriptions. Implement navigation to a detailed recipe view when a recipe item is pressed. Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n2.  Create a new file `app/recipe/[id].tsx` for the detailed recipe view, displaying all recipe information and a \"Save\" button.\n3.  Modify `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to ensure the tab bar is visible and functional.\n4.  Create a new file `app/(tabs)/saved.tsx` to display the list of saved recipes.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional recipe app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-26T08:59:20.177240"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a recipe app with browsing, saving, and sharing features!
