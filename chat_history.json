Here's the plan:\n\n**1. Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Browse Recipes:** A home screen displaying a list of available recipes with images, titles, and brief descriptions.\n-   **Recipe Details:** A detailed view for each recipe, including the full ingredient list, step-by-step cooking instructions, preparation time, and serving size.\n-   **Save Recipes:** Functionality for users to save their favorite recipes to a personal collection.\n\n**2. Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Beige)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#777777` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#A0522D` (Sienna)\n    *   Secondary: `#D2691E` (Chocolate)\n    *   Accent: `#BC8F8F` (Rosy Brown)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#E9967A` (Dark Salmon)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**3. Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Update the home screen to display a list of recipes. Each recipe item should include an image, title, and a brief description. This could involve fetching recipe data from a local array or, ideally, a Supabase database (if the user enables it).\n    *   Implement navigation to a detailed recipe view when a recipe item is pressed.\n    *   Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\n2.  **Create a new file `app/recipe/[id].tsx`:**\n    *   This file will contain the detailed recipe view.\n    *   It should display the recipe's image, title, ingredient list, cooking instructions, preparation time, and serving size.\n    *   Implement a \"Save\" button that allows users to save the recipe.\n\n3.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`:**\n    *   Ensure the tab bar is visible and functional.\n\n4.  **Create a new file `app/(tabs)/saved.tsx`:**\n    *   This file will display the list of saved recipes.\n\n**4. Instructions for the coding agent:**\n\n1.  Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to display a list of recipes with images, titles, and brief descriptions. Implement navigation to a detailed recipe view when a recipe item is pressed. Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n2.  Create a new file `app/recipe/[id].tsx` for the detailed recipe view, displaying all recipe information and a \"Save\" button.\n3.  Modify `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to ensure the tab bar is visible and functional.\n4.  Create a new file `app/(tabs)/saved.tsx` to display the list of saved recipes.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional recipe app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-26T08:59:20.177240"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a recipe app with browsing, saving, and sharing features!

Running the App:**\n\n*   **\"expo start\"**: This command starts the Expo development server, which is essential for running and testing React Native apps built with Expo. It will provide a QR code that you can scan with the Expo Go app on your phone, or you can run it in an emulator.\n\n**2. Testing the UI and Navigation:**\n\n*   **Browse Recipes:** Verify that the recipe cards are displayed correctly on the home screen (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`). Check the styling and layout.\n*   **Recipe Details:** Tap on a recipe card to navigate to the recipe details screen (`app/recipe/[id].tsx`). Ensure all the recipe information (title, ingredients, instructions, etc.) is displayed correctly.\n*   **Saved Recipes:** Navigate to the \"Saved\" tab (`app/(tabs)/saved.tsx`). Initially, it should be empty. After saving recipes, confirm that they appear in this tab.\n*   **Tab Navigation:** Test the navigation between the \"Home,\" \"Saved,\" and \"Profile\" tabs.\n\n**3. Testing the `useSavedRecipes` Hook:**\n\n*   **Save a Recipe:** On the recipe details screen, press the \"Save\" button. Verify that the button text changes to \"Unsave.\"\n*   **Unsave a Recipe:** Press the \"Unsave\" button. The button text should revert to \"Save.\"\n*   **Persistence:** Close and reopen the app. Check if the saved recipes are still saved in the \"Saved\" tab. This tests whether `AsyncStorage` is working correctly.\n*   **isRecipeSaved Function:** In `app/recipe/[id].tsx`, the `isRecipeSaved` function determines whether the save button displays \"Save\" or \"Unsave\". Test to make sure this function works correctly.\n\n**4. Component Rendering:**\n\n*   **RecipeCard:** Check that the `RecipeCard` component (`components/RecipeCard.tsx`) renders the recipe data correctly.\n*   **IconSymbol:** The `IconSymbol` component (`components/IconSymbol.tsx`) is used for displaying icons. Verify that the icons are displayed correctly.\n\n**5. Data:**\n\n*   **Recipe Data:** The recipe data is stored in `data/recipes.ts`. You can modify this file to add new recipes or change existing ones. Verify that the changes are reflected in the app.\n\n**6. Error Handling:**\n\n*   **Missing Recipe:** Try to access a recipe detail screen with an invalid ID (e.g., `/recipe/999`). The app should display the \"Recipe not found\" message.\n\n**7. General Prompts:**\n\n*   \"Does the app crash when I perform a certain action?\"\n*   \"Are there any visual glitches or layout issues?\"\n*   \"Is the app responsive on different screen sizes?\"\n\nBy working through these prompts, you should be able to thoroughly test the functionality of your recipe app.\n"}], "timestamp": "2025-10-26T09:35:08Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "how do i run the app locally"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "To run the app locally, you'll need to have Expo CLI installed.
